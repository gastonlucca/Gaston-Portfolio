# [Project 2:  Analysis of trends and metrics for La.Radio.live](https://github.com/gastonlucca/Gaston-Portfolio)
For this project I have select and define a series of metrics, relevant to analyze the performance of the Facebook site for the company, [LaRadio.live](https://laradio.live/)

Gathering all this information I was able to summary the performance of the Facebook site, estimate by linear regression the future like level. Through this analysis I have generated actionable conclusions and extraction of actionable insights, in order to calibrate the marketing strategy of the company.

# [ Project 10: Artificial Intelligence Hackathon (Winner)  ](https://github.com/gastonlucca/Gaston-Portfolio)


Problem statement: â€‹Digital Customer Support has identified duplications in Articles and Documents, which hinder customers from easily finding specific solutions to their issues or searches.

Goal:
Our objective is to develop a sustainable solution aligned with Schneider data standards that compares Articles, Documents, and Links, providing accurate similarity scores based on title andÂ responses comparisons.Additionally, use case-oriented visualizations will highlight potential duplicates, assisting agents in the analysis and optimization of the content.

SaasS Plataform: Dataiku

Librari: Faiss library

Data source analysis: Analysis of the Data Source reveal that Data source is unstructured and risks of Word-to-Word comparisons because of the dependency of the Content and Technical Specific.

Solution: Steps of the solution includes the following actions: Data Preparation, Data Validation, LMM, Reporting and Visualisation. (Dummy Data)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a97a6c88-33af-40f7-80a9-52d12d23f847)

Visualization: Developed on Tableau (Dummy Data)

Benefits the model  model :
Gives detailed matrix after one iteration of SS calculation

Using LLM we save the Context impact.

Flexible Threshold defined by user

Give the pool of similar FAQs biased SS and on FAQ related. 

Extract the FAQ if they are connected and allow fast access to online check

Risk Avoided:
Word-to-Word comparison lose the Context.

All Experts to use it as interface to make a final validation.

Scale up & Next steps
